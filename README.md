# What is PROJECT GENESIS?
PROJECT GENESIS, is my own intelligence network containing a wide arange of tools, programs, apps and systems that are aimed to be stand-alone, self-reliant and a tiny bit off the grid if you so wish to call it that. 

# What does PROJECT GENESIS CONTAIN:
I don't plan on stopping after these, but here is the current list.
- GENESIS os (Linux based Operating system) [WIP]
- P7077 (Private one-way encryption system)
- VIPER DRONE (Custom Perimiter security, Intelligence drone)
- GenesisNet (Custom social media platform) [WIP]


## GENESIS OS [WIP]:
GENESIS os is a linux-based operating system configured, modified towards my own thoughts and ideas, meant to be light-weight but also capable of running all programs from PROJECT GENESIS in a single click.

## P7077:
P7077 is a one-way encrypted private communication network that had it's idea based on the [DUTCH P2000 SYSTEM](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P2000_(network)>). However unlike that network,  mine comes with some improvements:
- Encryption (So no one other then that device can read the messages. Which it **DOES NOT** save locally.
- World wide-usage (If interent connection is provided)
- Better security
- Easy-to-add teams and custom configuration
- Some more security configurations
This one will soon be made into a physical device as well that you can carry with you at all times.

## VIPER DRONE:
The VIPER-DRONE is a combination of hardware and software working together to maintain awareness and an overview of perimeters, buildings or other important areas where watch is needed. 
It allows you to keep an eye on areas where no person can come or should come. (Drone is required to do the first part).
Some features include:

- AI detection.
- Optional visual feedback.
- Remote data transmission.
- Tracking of targets.
- Lightweight and optimized code..
- Automatic data encryption and security measures.
- Custom exclusion models to exclude certain people.
The program supports either cameras connected to the device it is run on, video files (and soon RTSP).

## GenesisNet
GenesisNet is my own social media platform focused on privacy and ease of access. 
- No bullshit trackers
- No  permanent data collection (Users can delete any post, comment when they so like, delete their profile etc)
- No ads
- No premium 
- No "For you" page
- No email or phone number required
- A simple to use platform without all the bullshit twitter, instagram or tiktok has.
